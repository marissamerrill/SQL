#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2;

#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FEBSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) DESC
LIMIT 1;
